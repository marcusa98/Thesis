# Measuring Quality of Unsupervised Learning: Evaluation of Density-Based Clustering

This repository organizes datasets and functions that I used and implemented for my masterthesis. 


## Repository Structure
`data/`: This folder contains datasets used for the analysis. 
The datasets that are not available via ClustPy or UCI Machine Learning Repository are included here. A description of where each of the other dataset used int my thesis was sourced from is also provided.

`functions/:`
- `dcsi.py` density-based CVI between 0 and 1
- `cvdd.py` density-based CVI between 0 and inf
- `dunn_index.py` non-density based CVI between 0 and inf
